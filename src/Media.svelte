<Project name="1:46.45 — The Unbroken National High School 800m Record" images={[

  <p>For this report, I interviewed record-holder <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Granville">Michael Granville</Link>, whose 1996 race performance at the semifinals of the California State Meet has yet to be matched. Beyond his running performance, the video explores his relationship with his father who coached him and unearths never-before-uploaded footage of the actual race. The video features original music I composed in high school as an 800m athlete.</p>

  <p>In recent years, residents of the Santa Cruz mountains have organized social media communities on Facebook to share trail camera footage of their wooded backyards. The shared media reveals just how prevalent, and elusive, mountain lions are in the bay area. I interviewed leaders of the social media groups and produced a video report and article.</p>
